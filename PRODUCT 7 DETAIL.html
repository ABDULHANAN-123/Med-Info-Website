                <b>DISPRIN</b>
                Dispirin is a brand name for a medication commonly containing aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), a widely
                used drug for its pain-relieving, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic (fever-reducing) properties. Below
                is a general description of Dispirin:

                Active Ingredient:
                Aspirin (Acetylsalicylic Acid)
                Uses:
                Pain relief: Effective for mild to moderate pain such as headaches, toothaches, muscle aches, and
                menstrual cramps.
                Anti-inflammatory: Reduces inflammation in conditions like arthritis.
                Fever reduction: Helps lower high body temperatures caused by infections.
                Blood-thinning: At lower doses, it prevents blood clots, reducing the risk of heart attacks and strokes
                (as directed by a healthcare provider).
                Mechanism of Action:
                Aspirin works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins—chemicals in the body responsible for pain,
                inflammation, and fever. Additionally, it interferes with platelet aggregation, making blood less likely
                to form clots.

                Dosage:
                Commonly available in 300 mg or 500 mg tablets.
                Always follow the recommended dosage as per the packaging or doctor's advice.
                Side Effects:
                Stomach irritation or upset
                Nausea or vomiting
                Risk of bleeding (especially with prolonged use or high doses)
                Allergic reactions in sensitive individuals
                Precautions:
                Avoid in individuals with stomach ulcers, bleeding disorders, or aspirin allergy.
                Not recommended for children under 16 (due to the risk of Reye’s syndrome).
                Should be used cautiously during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
                Consult a doctor before use if taking other medications like blood thinners or NSAIDs.
