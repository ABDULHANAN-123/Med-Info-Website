            <b>DECLORAN</b>
            Decloran-D is a pharmaceutical formulation often used to relieve symptoms associated with allergies, cold, or sinus congestion. It is a combination medication containing two active ingredients, Desloratadine and Pseudoephedrine, which work together to address multiple symptoms.

            Composition:
            Desloratadine: A long-acting antihistamine that reduces the effects of natural histamine in the body. It helps relieve symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, itchy or watery eyes, and skin rashes.
            Pseudoephedrine: A decongestant that works by shrinking the blood vessels in the nasal passages, leading to reduced nasal congestion.
            Uses:
            Decloran-D is indicated for the relief of:
            
            Nasal congestion due to colds or allergies.
            Sneezing and runny nose.
            Sinus pressure or pain.
            Symptoms of hay fever (allergic rhinitis).
            Dosage:
            Typically taken once or twice daily, depending on the formulation and severity of symptoms.
            It should be taken with a full glass of water and can be taken with or without food.
            Do not crush or chew extended-release tablets.
            Note: The exact dosage and duration should be prescribed by a healthcare professional based on individual needs and age.
            
            Precautions:
            Allergies: Inform your doctor if you are allergic to desloratadine, pseudoephedrine, or any other similar medications.
            Medical Conditions: Consult your doctor if you have:
            Heart disease or high blood pressure.
            Glaucoma.
            Thyroid disorders.
            Kidney or liver issues.
            Diabetes.
            Pregnancy and Breastfeeding: Use during pregnancy or breastfeeding only if recommended by a doctor.
            Interactions: Avoid combining with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or other decongestants.
            Side Effects:
            Common side effects may include:
            
            Dry mouth.
            Dizziness or drowsiness.
            Headache.
            Insomnia (due to pseudoephedrine).
            Rare but serious side effects:
            
            Increased heart rate.
            High blood pressure.
            Severe allergic reactions like swelling or difficulty breathing (seek immediate medical attention).
            Storage:
            Store at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.
            Keep out of reach of children.
            Important Notes:
            Avoid alcohol while taking Decloran-D, as it may enhance drowsiness.
            Do not exceed the recommended dosage.
            If symptoms persist for more than 7 days, consult your healthcare provider.
