            <b>PANADOL</b>
            Panadol is a widely recognized brand of medication whose active ingredient is paracetamol (also known as
            acetaminophen in the U.S. and Canada). It is used primarily as an analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic
            (fever reducer). Manufactured by GSK Consumer Healthcare, Panadol is available in various formulations to
            cater to different medical needs.

            Active Ingredient
            Paracetamol/Acetaminophen: A mild-to-moderate pain reliever and fever reducer.
            Uses
            Panadol is commonly used for:

            Pain Relief:

            Headaches, including migraines
            Muscle aches
            Toothaches
            Menstrual cramps
            Osteoarthritis
            Post-surgical pain
            Fever Reduction:

            Associated with colds, flu, or other infections.
            Combination Treatments:

            Sometimes combined with other ingredients to address specific conditions, such as cold and flu symptoms
            (e.g., Panadol Cold & Flu).
            Forms and Strengths
            Panadol is available in various forms, making it versatile and easy to use:

            Tablets: Regular, extra strength, or soluble.
            Caplets: Designed for easier swallowing.
            Syrups: For children.
            Suppositories: For patients who cannot take oral medication.
            Combination Medications: Often paired with caffeine, antihistamines, or decongestants.
            Mechanism of Action
            Panadol works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins in the brain, which are chemicals responsible
            for pain and fever.
            It does not have significant anti-inflammatory effects, differentiating it from drugs like ibuprofen or
            aspirin.
            Dosage
            Adults:

            Typically, 500 mg to 1,000 mg every 4â€“6 hours as needed.
            Maximum: 4,000 mg per day.
            Children:

            Dose depends on weight and age.
            Always use the pediatric formulation and consult a doctor or follow package instructions.
            Safety and Side Effects
            Paracetamol is generally well-tolerated when used as directed, but misuse can lead to severe complications.

            Common Side Effects:
            Nausea
            Rash (rare)
            Severe Risks (with overdose or prolonged use):
            Liver Damage: Overdose can lead to acute liver failure.
            Kidney Damage: Prolonged high doses can harm kidney function.
            Contraindications:
