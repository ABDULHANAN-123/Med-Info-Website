            <b>PARABIS</b>
            Parabis tablets are a medication often prescribed for pain relief, specifically in cases of musculoskeletal
            or inflammatory pain. These tablets usually contain Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) and Diclofenac or similar
            active ingredients, which work together to reduce pain and inflammation.

            Composition:
            Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):
            A common analgesic and antipyretic.
            Reduces pain and fever.
            Diclofenac Sodium:
            A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).
            Reduces inflammation and provides additional pain relief.
            Uses:
            Parabis tablets are commonly used to treat:

            Muscle and joint pain.
            Rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis.
            Post-surgical pain.
            Backache or neck pain.
            Headaches or migraines.
            Toothaches or gum pain.
            Menstrual pain (dysmenorrhea).
            Fever associated with inflammation.
            Dosage:
            Standard Dosage: Typically, one tablet is taken 2–3 times a day after meals, as prescribed by a physician.
            Maximum Limit: Should not exceed 3–4 grams of Paracetamol per day to avoid liver damage. Diclofenac intake
            should also be limited to prevent gastrointestinal side effects.
            Mechanism of Action:
            Paracetamol: Inhibits prostaglandin synthesis in the brain, reducing pain and fever.
            Diclofenac: Inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, decreasing inflammation and swelling.
            Side Effects:
            While effective, Parabis tablets may have side effects, especially if used improperly:

            Common Side Effects:
            Nausea or vomiting.
            Heartburn or indigestion.
            Drowsiness or dizziness.
            Serious Side Effects:
            Gastrointestinal bleeding or ulcers.
            Liver toxicity (from Paracetamol overdose).
            Kidney issues with prolonged use.
            Allergic reactions like rash, swelling, or difficulty breathing.
            Precautions:
            Avoid if allergic to NSAIDs or Paracetamol.
            Not recommended for individuals with:
            Liver or kidney disease.
            Stomach ulcers or bleeding disorders.
            Avoid alcohol consumption to reduce the risk of liver damage.
            Pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult a doctor before use.
            Drug Interactions:
            May interact with: Blood thinners (e.g., warfarin), other NSAIDs, and medications affecting the liver or
            kidneys.
            Avoid combining with: Excessive alcohol or medications containing additional Paracetamol.
            Storage:
            Store at room temperature (15–30°C) away from direct sunlight and moisture.
            Conclusion:
            Parabis tablets are effective for managing pain and inflammation but should be used with caution and under
            medical supervision to avoid potential side effects and complications. Always follow the dosage instructions
            provided by a healthcare professional.
