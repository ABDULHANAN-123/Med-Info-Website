            <b>WELLPAR</b>
            WELLPAR 500 mg is a brand of paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen), which is widely used for its
            analgesic (pain-relieving) and antipyretic (fever-reducing) properties. Below is detailed information about
            the medicine:

            Composition
            Active Ingredient: Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) 500 mg
            Indications
            WELLPAR 500 mg is used to relieve mild to moderate pain and reduce fever. Common conditions treated include:

            Pain Relief:
            Headaches
            Toothache
            Muscular pain
            Back pain
            Osteoarthritis
            Menstrual cramps
            Fever Reduction:
            Fever associated with colds, flu, or other infections
            Mechanism of Action
            Paracetamol works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins in the brain, chemicals responsible for
            pain and fever.
            It acts centrally (in the brain) to reduce pain and fever, unlike NSAIDs which act peripherally.
            Dosage and Administration
            Adults and Children over 12 years:
            Dose: 500–1000 mg (1–2 tablets) every 4–6 hours as needed.
            Maximum Daily Dose: Do not exceed 4000 mg (8 tablets) in 24 hours.
            Children (6–12 years):
            Dose: 250–500 mg every 4–6 hours as needed.
            Maximum Daily Dose: Not more than 60 mg/kg/day in divided doses.
            Note: Always follow the prescribing doctor’s recommendations.

            Contraindications
            Allergy or hypersensitivity to paracetamol.
            Severe liver disease.
            Side Effects
            Paracetamol is generally well-tolerated but can cause the following rare side effects:

            Mild:
            Nausea
            Rash or itching
            Severe (Rare):
            Liver damage (in cases of overdose or prolonged use)
            Allergic reactions (e.g., swelling, difficulty breathing)
            Precautions
            Avoid alcohol consumption during treatment to reduce liver strain.
            Patients with liver or kidney problems should consult a doctor before use.
            Do not exceed the recommended dose to avoid toxicity.
            Overdose
            Symptoms of overdose include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, sweating, and confusion.
            Overdose can cause severe liver damage and may be life-threatening.
            Immediate medical attention is required in case of overdose.
            Storage
            Store below 30°C in a dry place.
            Keep out of reach of children.

            WELLPAR 500 mg is available as an over-the-counter (OTC) medication but should be used responsibly.
