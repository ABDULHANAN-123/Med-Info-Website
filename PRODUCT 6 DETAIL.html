            <b>ASPIRIN</b>
            Aspirin, also known as acetylsalicylic acid, is a widely used medication with various applications,
            particularly as an anti-inflammatory and pain reliever. It is available in tablet form, often taken orally.
            Below is a detailed overview of aspirin tablets:

            Chemical Composition
            Active Ingredient: Acetylsalicylic acid.
            Inactive Ingredients (may vary by manufacturer): Cornstarch, lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, and
            others.
            Uses of Aspirin
            Pain Relief: Effective for mild to moderate pain such as headaches, menstrual cramps, muscle aches, and
            toothaches.
            Anti-inflammatory: Used in conditions like arthritis to reduce swelling and inflammation.
            Fever Reduction: Acts as an antipyretic to lower fever.
            Cardiovascular Health:
            Low-dose aspirin (81 mg): Helps prevent blood clots, reducing the risk of heart attack and stroke in
            individuals with cardiovascular disease.
            Prescribed for patients after certain heart procedures like angioplasty.
            Prevention of Blood Clots: Sometimes recommended in conditions like atrial fibrillation (under medical
            supervision).
            Dosage Forms
            Low-dose tablets: Typically 75-100 mg (commonly 81 mg, referred to as "baby aspirin").
            Regular-dose tablets: 325 mg.
            High-dose tablets: 500 mg or more, generally for acute pain or inflammation.
            Mechanism of Action
            Aspirin works by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, specifically COX-1 and COX-2. This prevents the
            formation of prostaglandins, which are chemicals responsible for pain, fever, and inflammation. It also
            inhibits thromboxane, reducing platelet aggregation and preventing blood clots.

            Administration
            Route: Oral (tablet taken with water).
            Dosage: Depends on the condition being treated. For example:
            Pain relief: 325-650 mg every 4-6 hours as needed.
            Cardiovascular prevention: 75-100 mg daily.
            Side Effects
            Common Side Effects:
            Nausea or vomiting.
            Heartburn or upset stomach.
            Serious Side Effects (less common):
            Stomach ulcers or bleeding.
            Allergic reactions (rash, difficulty breathing).
            Ringing in the ears (tinnitus), especially at higher doses.
            Liver or kidney damage with prolonged use.
            Precautions
            Avoid in Specific Conditions:
            Bleeding disorders (e.g., hemophilia).
            Stomach ulcers or a history of gastrointestinal bleeding.
            Allergies to aspirin or NSAIDs.
            Contraindications:
            Children under 16 with viral infections (risk of Reye's syndrome).
            Pregnancy (especially in the third trimester unless prescribed by a doctor).
            Drug Interactions:
            Can interact with blood thinners (e.g., warfarin), other NSAIDs, or certain diuretics.
            Storage
            Store in a cool, dry place.
            Keep out of reach of children.
            Discard if the tablets smell like vinegar (indicates degradation).
            Key Considerations
            Aspirin should always be taken as directed by a healthcare provider, especially in cases of long-term use
            for heart health.
            Overdose can cause toxicity, leading to symptoms like confusion, hyperventilation, and even coma.
            Aspirin is a versatile medication but requires careful use to balance its benefits and risks effectively.
