            <b>CIPRALEX</b>
            Cipralex is a brand name for a medication that contains aspirin as its active ingredient. Aspirin, also
            known as acetylsalicylic acid, is a widely used over-the-counter drug known for its analgesic, antipyretic,
            and anti-inflammatory properties. Below is a detailed overview of Dispirin:

            Composition
            Active Ingredient: Cipralex (acetylsalicylic acid)
            Form: Available as tablets, typically 300 mg or other doses depending on the formulation.
            Uses
            Dispirin is used to treat a variety of conditions, including:

            Pain Relief:

            Headaches, migraines
            Toothache
            Muscle and joint pain
            Menstrual cramps
            Fever Reduction:

            Used to lower body temperature in cases of fever.
            Anti-Inflammatory:

            Helps reduce swelling and inflammation in conditions like arthritis.
            Heart and Blood Vessel Protection:

            In low doses, aspirin is used to prevent blood clots, reducing the risk of heart attacks and strokes.
            Mechanism of Action
            Aspirin works by inhibiting the enzymes cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). This reduces
            the production of prostaglandins and thromboxane, which are responsible for pain, inflammation, and blood
            clotting.

            Dosage and Administration
            For pain and fever: Typically 300–600 mg every 4–6 hours as needed.
            For cardiovascular protection: 75–100 mg daily, as prescribed by a doctor.
            Note: Always follow the recommended dose and consult a healthcare professional for proper guidance.
            Side Effects
            While generally safe when taken as directed, Dispirin can cause side effects, including:

            Stomach upset or irritation
            Heartburn
            Nausea and vomiting
            Increased risk of bleeding (due to blood-thinning effects)
            Allergic reactions (rash, difficulty breathing)
            Tinnitus (ringing in the ears) at high doses
            Contraindications
            Dispirin should not be used in the following cases:

            Allergy to Aspirin or NSAIDs
            Bleeding Disorders (e.g., hemophilia)
            Peptic Ulcer Disease
            Asthma (in sensitive individuals, it may trigger asthma attacks)
            Children or Teenagers with Viral Infections
            Associated with Reye's syndrome, a rare but serious condition.
            Precautions
            Avoid alcohol, as it may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
            Use with caution in people with kidney or liver problems.
            Pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult a doctor before use.
            Storage
            Store in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.
            Keep out of reach of children.
            Conclusion
            Dispirin is a versatile medication for pain relief, fever reduction, and heart health when used correctly.
            However, it is important to use it as directed and consult a healthcare provider for specific conditions or
            prolonged use.
